# Unported files from second edition

These are PDFs and generated Markdown files from the [chapters of the second
edition](http://www.resample.com/intro-text-online).

The procedure was:

* Convert PDF to HTML using Adobe Illustrator.
* Use custom HTML processing to clean up resulting HTML.  Ask me (Matthew) if
  you want to see the scripts for this.
* Convert processed HTML to Markdown with Pandoc.
